## Motivation

This project originated from the need for a more flexible and consistent theming system that could be applied across a wide range of applications. While existing solutions offered partial coverage, they often fell short when it came to adapting to specific design requirements or maintaining coherence across multiple contexts.

The initial motivation stemmed from the desire to streamline theming workflows and reduce repetitive setup across projects, especially in environments where a shared design language is essential. Over time, this developed into a more comprehensive solution â€” capable of reflecting both general design principles and more opinionated stylistic preferences, without compromising scalability or maintainability.
